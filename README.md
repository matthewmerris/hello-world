# hello-world
catch all

I am a versitile person currently pursuing a PhD in computing at Boise State University.
My BS is in Physics with a minor in Mathematics.  Additionally, I am a life-long
musician and avid outdoorsman.   Data is everywhere, happening always.  We just need better
ways to engage it.
