# hello-world
catch all

I am a versitile person currently pursuing a second bachelor degree in computer science.
My first degree is in Physics with a minor in Mathematics.  Additionally, I am a life-long
musician and avid outdoorsman.   Data is everywhere, happening always.  We just need better
ways to engage it.
